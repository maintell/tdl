# Expr Guide

Expr is powered by [expr](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr), which is a simple, lightweight, yet powerful expression
engine.

Expression engine docs: https://expr.medv.io/docs/Language-Definition

It's powerful but may be a little hard to new users. So feel free to file an issue if you have any questions about the
expression engine.
